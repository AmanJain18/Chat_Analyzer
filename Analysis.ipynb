      "Modern experimental science projects have reached mega and Giga scales in terms of size and complexity of the experiments as well as their costs and collaborations. The experiments not only thrive on the state-of-the-art technologies in the areas of detectors, electronics, instrumentation, software and so on but quite often seek inventions in these areas. The resultant spinoffs and applications benefit the mankind at large. This talk will introduce some of the world‚Äôs largest science projects in operation or under construction and highlight the Indian technology contributions for these. The challenging opportunities waiting for the young engineers will be particularly emphasised. \n",

      "Quality of Engineering Education in India is a matter of concern for academicians, industries, and regulatory authorities. Limited exposure to the industrial world, lack of experienced faculty members, and ineffective laboratory facilities in institutes add to this problem. Much is said about this on many expositions. The \"Integrated Technologies Olympiad\" is a step towards bridging the gap between demands from industries and existing vocational curriculum. While a few tier-1 and tier-2 colleges have already started including 6 months of industrial experience as a part of the standard curriculum, it is a distant reality for many other engineering institutions in India. InTech Olympiad provides this opportunity to a group of students from the engineering institutes across India.  \n",
      "The very nature of the event will certainly help students to acquire the \"Learning to Learn\" skill, which is utmost important for survival in this industrial world. The event has been designed after an elaborate discussion with industry partners and academicians. This event will give the students hands-on experience in solving industrial problems with mentoring from experts. Refer to http://intecholympiad.org/ \n",
      "After successful completion of ‚Äúonline summer internship‚Äù in July 2020, we are now offering ‚ÄúInTech Olympiad 2021‚Äù. This is the 7th edition of this program. The lessons learnt during the COVID must help all of us to think differently. This is a little attempt from the passionate group of InTech Olympiad to propose one more opportunity for students to interact with industry veterans and work with them to solve industrial problems. The registration is open, and we request you to inform students of any year of Engineering and from any branch to participate in this unique problem solving, online, six-month internship. The features of this internship are: \n",
      "Students from different branches will work on a live problem statement \n",
      "A dedicated industrial mentor will guide these groups  \n",
      "An exhaustive assessment and interaction system will ensure the participation of the students \n",
      "Webinars by eminent personalities in the chosen domain, and soft skills \n",
      "Development of solutions, and an opportunity to implement the ideas for selected groups in chosen industries  \n",
      "The detailed program is published on the portal. Kindly circulate amongst the students and encourage them to participate. More details about this event are available on http://intecholympiad.org/  \n",
      "Since these are equivalent of internship activities, successful students as per the evaluation criteria will get internship certificates at the end of the event and the students who perform exceptionally well are likely to get a letter of recommendation. It has been our experience in the past, that some of the students were offered extended internship or employment offers at the end of the event by some of the organisations, thus providing them with a dream start to their careers in their areas of interest.  \n",

      "At the outset, I would like to appreciate you for putting in tremendous efforts towards your academic journey since March 2020. Despite the prevalent health concerns and mercurial situation owing to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, you have done a great job in prioritizing your studies and completing all your tasks diligently. The sudden shift from a classroom environment to attending classes online has certainly not been easy for the student community. You are no less than any Covid warrior as you have adjusted to the adversity with courage, and you are upgrading yourself to take on new challenges, while simultaneously taking care of your health and managing the home front!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure that the TE, BE and MMS students will have happy memories of the days spent on the Vidyalankar campus, group projects in the Labs, studying in the Reading Room, hanging out with friends in the cafeteria and Den, participating in events in the auditorium and Plaza and many other nostalgic instances of college life. A special shout out to our SE and FE students who have formed close bonds with their classmates, even without getting the opportunity to meet each other in person!\n",
      "\n",
      "You might have come across some news articles regarding the reopening of colleges in physical mode. Lately, there have been many queries from students and parents regarding coming offline to college. We understand you are eager to come to the campus, but it is natural that your family members will be anxious about the health risks involved in commuting and studying in a classroom environment. At the same time, some aspects of your engineering education will be incomplete without a hands-on learning experience, so that also needs to be taken care of.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we are also eagerly awaiting your return to the campus, as students are the life of the college, such an important decision cannot be taken in haste. Your well-being is our highest priority, and we need to consider all the parameters. So, till 20 February 2022, classes will continue only in online mode. After that, we will review the situation, make necessary arrangements, and consider commencing offline classes while maintaining social distancing and other essential protocols.\n",

One of the Contributors in MEGA Science Projects in India and abroad.\\nAbstract:\\nModern experimental science projects have reached mega and Giga scales in terms of size and complexity of the experiments as well as their costs and collaborations. The experiments not only thrive on the state-of-the-art technologies in the areas of detectors, electronics, instrumentation, software and so on but quite often seek inventions in these areas. The resultant spinoffs and applications benefit the mankind at large. This talk will introduce some of the world‚Äôs largest science projects in operation or under construction and highlight the Indian technology contributions for these. The challenging opportunities waiting for the young engineers will be particularly emphasised. \\n\\n\\nLInk :\\n\\nJoin Zoom Meeting \\n\\nhttps://zoom.us/j/99640324064?pwd=WWhvSWdzblA3eFBQdU1KUW1EK3M0dz09 \\n\\n\\n\\nMeeting ID: 996 4032 4064 \\n\\nPasscode: 356166 \\n\\n\\nI request you all to mark your calendar and attend the talk,\\n',\n",

       " '+91 95036 84404: Greetings of New Year 2021 from AICTE..!!\\nQuality of Engineering Education in India is a matter of concern for academicians, industries, and regulatory authorities. Limited exposure to the industrial world, lack of experienced faculty members, and ineffective laboratory facilities in institutes add to this problem. Much is said about this on many expositions. The \"Integrated Technologies Olympiad\" is a step towards bridging the gap between demands from industries and existing vocational curriculum. While a few tier-1 and tier-2 colleges have already started including 6 months of industrial experience as a part of the standard curriculum, it is a distant reality for many other engineering institutions in India. InTech Olympiad provides this opportunity to a group of students from the engineering institutes across India.  \\nThe very nature of the event will certainly help students to acquire the \"Learning to Learn\" skill, which is utmost important for survival in this industrial world. The event has been designed after an elaborate discussion with industry partners and academicians. This event will give the students hands-on experience in solving industrial problems with mentoring from experts. Refer to http://intecholympiad.org/ \\nAfter successful completion of ‚Äúonline summer internship‚Äù in July 2020, we are now offering ‚ÄúInTech Olympiad 2021‚Äù. This is the 7th edition of this program. The lessons learnt during the COVID must help all of us to think differently. This is a little attempt from the passionate group of InTech Olympiad to propose one more opportunity for students to interact with industry veterans and work with them to solve industrial problems. The registration is open, and we request you to inform students of any year of Engineering and from any branch to participate in this unique problem solving, online, six-month internship. The features of this internship are: \\nStudents from different branches will work on a live problem statement \\nA dedicated industrial mentor will guide these groups  \\nAn exhaustive assessment and interaction system will ensure the participation of the students \\nWebinars by eminent personalities in the chosen domain, and soft skills \\nDevelopment of solutions, and an opportunity to implement the ideas for selected groups in chosen industries  \\nThe detailed program is published on the portal. Kindly circulate amongst the students and encourage them to participate. More details about this event are available on http://intecholympiad.org/  \\nSince these are equivalent of internship activities, successful students as per the evaluation criteria will get internship certificates at the end of the event and the students who perform exceptionally well are likely to get a letter of recommendation. It has been our experience in the past, that some of the students were offered extended internship or employment offers at the end of the event by some of the organisations, thus providing them with a dream start to their careers in their areas of interest.  \\nPlease circulate this information to all the faculty and students from your esteemed Institute to avail the benefit from \"InTech Olympiad2021\".   \\n For more information, you may contact: \\nProf. Sudhir Agashe\\nProfessor, Instrumentation, and Control\\nPrincipal Investigator Virtual Laboratory Project (NMEICT)\\nCollege of Engineering, Pune\\n+91 20 25507172\\n',\n",
